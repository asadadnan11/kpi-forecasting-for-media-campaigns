## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced **time series forecasting techniques** for optimizing media campaign performance through data-driven insights. By leveraging synthetic campaign data, we build predictive models to forecast key marketing KPIs including **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)**, **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**, daily spend, and conversion metrics.

The solution enables marketing teams to make proactive budget allocation decisions, identify optimization opportunities, and maximize campaign efficiency through predictive analytics.

## 📊 Key Objectives

- **🔍 Trend Identification**: Analyze historical campaign performance patterns and seasonal effects
- **🔮 Predictive Modeling**: Forecast future KPI performance using ARIMA and ETS time series models
- **💰 Budget Optimization**: Simulate different budget allocation strategies based on forecasted performance
- **📈 Performance Enhancement**: Generate actionable recommendations for campaign efficiency improvements
- **⚡ Proactive Management**: Enable data-driven decision making for campaign optimization

### 1. Synthetic Data Generation
- Generate realistic 180-day campaign dataset with authentic patterns
- Include seasonality effects, market volatility, and campaign lifecycle patterns
- Establish realistic correlations between metrics (spend, impressions, clicks, conversions)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Comprehensive statistical analysis and visualization of campaign KPIs
- Day-of-week performance analysis and seasonal pattern identification
- Correlation analysis between different marketing metrics

### 3. Time Series Modeling
- **ARIMA Models**: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average for trend-based forecasting

- Stationarity testing and model parameter optimization

### 4. Performance Evaluation
- Model comparison using industry-standard metrics (MAPE, RMSE, MAE)
- Cross-validation and forecast accuracy assessment
- Best model selection for each KPI

### 5. Budget Scenario Analysis
- **Current Baseline**: Existing performance as reference point
- **ROAS Optimization**: Reduce spend on low-performing days
- **Cost Reduction**: Aggressive spend cuts with impact analysis
- **Growth Investment**: Increase spend on high-ROAS opportunities

### 6. Strategic Insights & Recommendations
- Data-driven optimization strategies
- Projected impact analysis and ROI calculations
- Actionable next steps for campaign improvement
