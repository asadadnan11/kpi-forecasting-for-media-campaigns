## 🎯 Project Overview

This **academic simulation project** demonstrates the application of time series forecasting techniques to media campaign optimization challenges. Using synthetically generated campaign data, this analysis explores how predictive modeling could theoretically be applied to forecast key marketing KPIs including **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)**, **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**, daily spend, and conversion metrics.

The project serves as a learning exercise to understand how data science methodologies might be applied in marketing analytics contexts, while exploring the practical challenges and limitations of forecasting in dynamic advertising environments.

## 📊 Learning Objectives

- **🔍 Methodology Application**: Apply time series analysis techniques to marketing data challenges
- **🔮 Model Comparison**: Compare ARIMA vs ETS forecasting approaches for different KPI types
- **💰 Scenario Analysis**: Demonstrate how predictive models could inform budget allocation decisions
- **📈 Business Context**: Translate statistical findings into business-relevant insights and recommendations
- **⚡ Critical Thinking**: Evaluate model limitations and real-world implementation challenges

## 📝 Academic Context & Limitations

> **🎓 ACADEMIC SIMULATION**: This project is designed as a **graduate-level business school simulation** using entirely synthetic data. All campaign data, performance metrics, and optimization results are artificially generated for educational purposes.
> 
> **⚠️ IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS**: 
> - Results do not reflect real marketing campaign performance
> - Efficiency gains and cost savings are theoretical calculations based on synthetic data
> - Real-world implementation would face additional challenges (market dynamics, competitive responses, data quality issues)
> - Models have not been validated against actual campaign data
> 
> This analysis demonstrates **methodology and analytical thinking** rather than proven business outcomes.
